# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This assignment was to take a existing website and its code and clean up the code, fix any errors in functionality and apperance.
This took quite a bit of time and effort since this was my first undertaking in refractory.  I hope that I accomplished what this task was
meant to teach us.

I first went through and cleaned up some of the html code and added comments throughout what each area had in it and the functionality if there was some.
Next I went through the .CSS file and labeled and structured the code based on the structure of hte HTML file.  If the code was general I placed it on top, then I structured it according to the areas from the header to the footer.

Throuout this process I constantly saved, opened the page to test it and used google inspector to verify that things looked the same as before and the funtionality was not broken.

I did struggle with the unordered list and where and how it should be placed.  I left it in the header catagory because that seemed to work best.
